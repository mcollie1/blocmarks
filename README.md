== README

## Bloccit: a social bookmarking with email integration application.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

== Ruby on Rails
* ruby 2.0.0p451
* rails 4.0.1

== Database
* development - sqlite3
* production - pg

== configuration
By default Rails 4 will not serve assets. To enable this functionality we went into config/application.rb and added this line:
config.serve_static_assets = true

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
